**Impact**: High - Could break core integrations and functionality

**Mitigation**:
- Active participation in protocol development communities
- Maintaining compatibility layers for multiple protocol versions
- Building flexible architecture to adapt to changes
- Regular monitoring of protocol development discussions

### 2. Platform Fragmentation
**Risk**: Fediverse platforms diverging or new platforms emerging

**Impact**: Medium - Increased development and maintenance costs

**Mitigation**:
- Modular integration architecture for easy platform addition
- Community-driven integration development
- Focus on protocol standards rather than platform-specific features
- Automated testing for platform compatibility

### 3. Scalability Challenges
**Risk**: Performance issues as customer base and data volume grow

**Impact**: High - Could impact customer satisfaction and retention

**Mitigation**:
- Cloud-native architecture with horizontal scaling
- Microservices design for independent scaling
