# Security Framework

## Overview

FediFlow's security framework implements defense-in-depth principles with comprehensive authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance measures designed for educational institutions and federated environments.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)
- SMS and email verification
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Biometric authentication support
- Backup code generation

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- SAML 2.0 integration
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) support
- Active Directory Federation Services
- Google Workspace integration
- Microsoft Azure AD integration

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation
- Authorization code flow
- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- Refresh token rotation
- Scope-based access control
- JWT token validation

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "student": {
      "permissions": ["read:courses", "read:activities", "create:submissions"]
    },
    "faculty": {
      "permissions": ["read:courses", "write:courses", "read:activities", "create:activities", "grade:assignments"]
    },
    "admin": {
      "permissions": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### JSON Web Token (JWT) Management
- RSA-256 signature verification
- Token expiration and renewal
- Blacklist management for revoked tokens
- Claims validation and extraction
- Cross-service token propagation

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- AES-256 encryption for database storage
- Encrypted file system for media storage
- Key rotation and management
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- Backup encryption with separate keys

### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Certificate pinning for API endpoints
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Certificate transparency monitoring

### Data Sovereignty
- Regional data residency controls
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions
- Data localization compliance
- Tenant-specific encryption keys
- Regulatory jurisdiction mapping

### Privacy by Design
- Data minimization principles
- Purpose limitation enforcement
- Storage limitation policies
- Accuracy and integrity controls
- Transparent data processing

## Compliance Framework

### GDPR Compliance
- Right to access implementation
- Right to rectification procedures
- Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)
- Data portability mechanisms
- Consent management system

#### Data Subject Rights Implementation
```json
{
  "gdpr_requests": {
    "access": {
      "endpoint": "/api/gdpr/access",
      "format": "json",
      "delivery": "secure_download"
    },
    "deletion": {
      "endpoint": "/api/gdpr/delete",
      "verification": "multi_factor",
      "cascade": "controlled"
    }
  }
}
```

## Identity Management

### User Authentication

- Time-based access restrictions
- Location-based access controls

## Security Monitoring

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoint protection
- Per-user and per-IP limits
- Adaptive rate limiting
- DDoS protection measures
- Legitimate traffic prioritization

### Audit Logging
```json
{
  "audit_log": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "action": "course.access",
    "resource": "course-uuid",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "result": "success",
