# System Architecture

## Overview

FediFlow's system architecture is built on modern distributed computing principles, leveraging federated protocols and cloud-native technologies to create a scalable, secure, and interoperable platform.

## Core Components

### API Gateway
- Central entry point for all client requests
- Rate limiting and authentication
- Request routing and load balancing
- Protocol translation and adaptation

### Microservices Architecture
- Decoupled service design for scalability
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- Event-driven architecture patterns

### Federation Protocol
- ActivityPub protocol implementation
- JSON-LD for structured data exchange
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication

### Frontend Development
- Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Responsive design for multi-device support
- Modern web standards compliance

### Integration Hub
- Third-party service integrations
- API aggregation and normalization
- Data transformation and mapping
- Webhook management

## Infrastructure Components

### Container Technology
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Service mesh implementation
- Auto-scaling capabilities

### Cloud Native Design
- Microservices architecture
- API-first design
- Event-driven patterns
- Observability built-in

### Multi-Tenancy
- Isolated tenant environments
- Shared infrastructure optimization
- Tenant-specific customization
- Resource allocation and monitoring

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- Node.js runtime environment
- RESTful API design
- GraphQL for complex queries
- Event sourcing patterns

### Data Layer
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Time-series database for analytics
- NoSQL for document storage

### Communication Protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS for standard requests
- WebSocket for real-time features
- ActivityPub for federation
- gRPC for internal services

## Scalability Features

### Horizontal Scaling

- Health checks and self-healing

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- Data at rest encryption
- Secure communication channels
- Privacy by design principles

### Compliance Framework
