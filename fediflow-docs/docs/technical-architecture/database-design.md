# Database Design

## Overview

FediFlow's database architecture is designed for scalability, performance, and data integrity across a distributed federated environment. The design supports multi-tenancy, real-time analytics, and compliance requirements.

## Database Architecture

### Primary Database: PostgreSQL
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Advanced indexing and query optimization
- JSON/JSONB support for flexible schemas
- Full-text search capabilities
- Horizontal and vertical scaling support

### Caching Layer: Redis
- Session management and user state
- Application-level caching
- Real-time data structures
- Pub/sub messaging patterns
- Distributed locking mechanisms

### Analytics Database: Time-Series
- Performance metrics collection
- User behavior analytics
- System monitoring data
- Historical trend analysis
- Real-time dashboard support

### Document Storage: NoSQL
- Unstructured content storage
- Media and file metadata
- Configuration and settings
- Flexible schema evolution
- Content versioning support

## Data Models

### Core Entities

#### Users and Identity
```sql
-- User accounts and profiles
users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  profile_data JSONB,
  tenant_id UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
)

-- Federation identity mapping
federation_identities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  federation_id VARCHAR,
  instance_url VARCHAR,
  public_key TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### Content and Activities
```sql
-- ActivityPub objects
activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  type VARCHAR,
  actor_id UUID,
  object_data JSONB,
  published_at TIMESTAMP,
  tenant_id UUID
)

-- Content storage
content (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  activity_id UUID REFERENCES activities(id),
  content_type VARCHAR,
  content_data JSONB,
  visibility VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### Academic Services
```sql
-- Course management
courses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID,
  course_code VARCHAR,
  title VARCHAR,
  description TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)

-- Student enrollment
enrollments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  role VARCHAR,
  status VARCHAR,
  enrolled_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Indexing Strategy

#### Performance Indexes
- B-tree indexes for primary keys and foreign keys
- GIN indexes for JSONB columns
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Partial indexes for filtered queries

#### Full-Text Search
- Text search vectors for content discovery
- Multilingual search support
- Ranking and relevance scoring
- Search result caching

#### Geospatial Indexes
- Location-based content discovery
- Regional content filtering
- Distance calculations
- Spatial queries optimization

## Scalability Design

### Database Clustering
- Master-slave replication
- Read replica distribution
- Connection pooling
- Load balancing strategies

### Sharding Strategy
- Tenant-based sharding
- Geographic sharding
- Time-based partitioning
- Cross-shard query optimization

### Data Archiving
- Automated data lifecycle management
- Cold storage migration
- Compliance retention policies
- Query performance optimization

## Data Integrity

### ACID Properties
- Atomicity for transaction consistency
- Consistency for data validation
- Isolation for concurrent operations
- Durability for data persistence

### Backup and Recovery
- Automated backup scheduling
- Point-in-time recovery
- Cross-region backup replication
- Disaster recovery procedures

### Data Validation
- Schema validation at application layer
- Database constraints and triggers
- Data quality monitoring
- Anomaly detection

## Security Measures

### Encryption
- Data at rest encryption
- Column-level encryption for sensitive data
- Key management and rotation
- Secure backup encryption

### Access Control
- Role-based database access
- Connection encryption (TLS)
- Database user privilege separation
- Audit logging and monitoring

### Compliance Features
- GDPR data subject rights
- Data retention policies
- Audit trail maintenance
- Privacy impact assessments

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization
- Query plan analysis and optimization
- Automated statistics updates
- Index usage monitoring
- Slow query identification

### Connection Management
- Connection pooling configuration
- Idle connection cleanup
- Connection limit management
- Load balancing across replicas

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time performance metrics
- Resource utilization tracking
- Alert threshold configuration
- Automated scaling triggers
